# Python-Selenium-Test

If you have pip on your system, you can simply install or upgrade the Python bindings:
pip install -U selenium

Alternately, you can download the source distribution from PyPI (e.g. selenium-4.7.1.tar.gz), unarchive it, and run:
python setup.py install

Note: You may want to consider using virtualenv to create isolated Python environments.
